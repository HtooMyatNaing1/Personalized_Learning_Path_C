=== Pointer Fundamentals ===

A pointer is a variable that stores a memory address.

Declaration:
    int *p;

This means:
    p can store the address of an int
    *p refers to the int value at that address

Address-of operator (&):
    int x = 10;
    int *p = &x;

Now:
    p  → address of x
    *p → value of x (10)

Dereferencing (*):
    *p = 20;   // modifies x

Key rules:
- A pointer must point to valid memory before dereferencing
- Uninitialized pointers are dangerous
- NULL means "points to nothing"

NULL pointer:
    int *p = NULL;

Always check before use.

Memory model:
Variables live in memory.
Pointers let you refer to that memory indirectly.

Why pointers exist:
- Efficient data access
- Dynamic memory
- Function side effects
- Low-level control

Golden rule:
Never dereference what you did not initialize.
