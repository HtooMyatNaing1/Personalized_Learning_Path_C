=== Dynamic Memory ===

Static memory:
- Allocated at compile time
- Fixed size

Dynamic memory:
- Allocated at runtime
- Controlled by programmer

Functions:
    malloc   → allocate uninitialized memory
    calloc   → allocate zeroed memory
    realloc  → resize memory
    free     → release memory

Example:
    int *p = malloc(sizeof(int) * 5);

Always check:
    if (p == NULL)

Using memory:
    p[0] = 10;

Freeing memory:
    free(p);
    p = NULL;

Rules:
- Every malloc/calloc must have a free
- Never use memory after free
- Never free the same pointer twice

realloc behavior:
- May move memory
- Old pointer becomes invalid

Correct realloc:
    int *tmp = realloc(p, new_size);
    if (tmp) p = tmp;

Dynamic memory is powerful but unforgiving.
