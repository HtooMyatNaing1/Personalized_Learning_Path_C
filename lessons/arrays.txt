=== Pointers & Arrays ===

Arrays and pointers are closely related, but not identical.

Array declaration:
    int arr[5];

Pointer to array:
    int *p = arr;

Important truth:
    arr == &arr[0]

Access methods:
    arr[i]  == *(arr + i)
    p[i]    == *(p + i)

Pointer arithmetic:
- Incrementing a pointer moves by sizeof(type)
- p + 1 moves to the next int

Example:
    int arr[3] = {10, 20, 30};
    int *p = arr;

    *(p + 1) → 20

What you CANNOT do:
    arr = p;   // invalid
    arr++;     // invalid

Why?
Arrays are fixed memory blocks.
Pointers are variables.

Arrays decay to pointers when passed to functions.

Mental model:
Array name = constant pointer to first element.
